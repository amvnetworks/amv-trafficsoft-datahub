amv-trafficsoft-datahub
========

amv-trafficsoft-datahub is a replication module for XFCD data interacting with AMV TrafficSoftÂ®.
Please note that this software is considered experimental until v1.0.0 is reached.

# usage
The [application.yml](example-app/src/main/resources/application.yml) acts as a
template for your own configuration parameter.

## configuration
Copy the contents of the `application.yml` file to `application-my-profile.yml`
and start the application with `--spring.profiles.active=my-profile`.
Or simply adapt the `application.yml` contents to your needs.

# development
As this project uses [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) make sure you have
annotation processing enabled (IntelliJ users can use the
[IntelliJ Lombok Plugin](https://github.com/mplushnikov/lombok-intellij-plugin)).

## build
Build a snapshot from a clean working directory
```bash
$ ./gradlew releaseCheck clean build -Prelease.stage=SNAPSHOT -Prelease.scope=patch
```

When a parameter `minimal` is provided, certain tasks will be skipped to make the build faster.
e.g. `findbugs`, `checkstyle`, `javadoc` - tasks which results are not essential for a working build.
```bash
./gradlew clean build -Pminimal
```

### publish SNAPSHOT to local maven repository
```
./gradlew clean build -Pminimal -Prelease.stage=SNAPSHOT -Prelease.scope=patch publishToMavenLocal
```

### create a release
```bash
./gradlew final -Prelease.scope=patch
```

### release to bintray
```bash
./gradlew clean build final bintrayUpload
  -Prelease.useLastTag=true
  -PreleaseToBintray
  -PbintrayUser=${username}
  -PbintrayApiKey=${apiKey}
```
